A simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame. The objective is to navigate the bird through pipes without colliding, while scoring points by passing through the gaps.

## Features

- Basic UI
- Dynamic pipe generation at random positions
- Scoring system
- Sound effects
- Game restart option

## Requirements

- Python 3.X
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Install Pygame globally using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

3. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/draganovdimitar2/pygame.git
    ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
5. Run the game:
