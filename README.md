# Just a simple Pygame Repository

This repository contains basic implementations of classic games using the Pygame library. For now, it includes two separate game projects:

## Games Included

### 1. Snake Game (under development)
A simple Snake game where the player controls a growing snake, aiming to collect food while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen boundaries. Please note that this game is still in development, and features may change.

### 2. Flappy Bird Clone
A basic Flappy Bird clone where the player controls a bird that must navigate through gaps between pipes by flapping its wings.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository and improve the games by adding new features, refining mechanics, or enhancing graphics!
